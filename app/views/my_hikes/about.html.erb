					<dt><a href="">What is the Fresh Hikes Finder?</a></dt>
					<dd>The Fresh Hikes Finder wants to help HK hikers maximize the benefits of hiking by choosing routes with the best air quality on any given day or hour. It combines government data on various districts' air quality (AQHI and AQI) and weather with hiking route data in order to recommend the 'freshest' hikes for any given day or hour. 

					It is in its current state a web prototype, but The Fresh Hikes Finder will eventually take the form of a mobile app. </dd>

					<dt><a href="">That big number on the bottom left of the hike cards - what does it mean and how is it calculated?</a></dt>
					<dd>That's the Freshness Factor - it is a combination of data from the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and the AQI (Air Quality Index), turned into a percentage and inverted so that the higher the number, the better. This number is updated on an hourly basis for each of the 14 districts. If a hike spans more than one district or air quality measuring station, a weighted average is taken.</dd>

					<dt><a href="">The different colours of the hike cards - what do they mean?</a></dt>
					<dd>These colours indicate the Health Risk Levels, as measured and colour coded by the Air Quality Health Index (www.aqhi.gov.hk):
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-1"> 1 - Low </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-2"> 2 - Low </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-3"> 3 - Low </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-4"> 4 - Moderate </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-5"> 5 - Moderate </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-6"> 6 - Moderate </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-7"> 7 - High </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-8"> 8 - Very high  </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-9"> 9 - Very high</div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-10"> 10 - Very high </div>
						<div class="colorcode aqi-level-11"> 11 - Serious </div>
					</dd>

					<dt><a href="">Where are you getting your hiking route data from?</a></dt>
					<dd>The hiking route data is taken from www.mapmyhike.com, a platform and community for collecting and displaying all kinds of hiking route data around HK. The amount of user-generated-data collected is amazing. Hikers, sign up!</dd>

					<dt><a href="">I've seen a few 'coming soons' around the app. What other features are coming soon?</a></dt>
					<dd>
						Great question! Coming up are the ability to:
						<ol>
							<li>View more hiking routes and cool information such as elevation graphs</li><br>
							<li> Have more integrated weather data such as UV radiation and temperature</li><br>
							<li>Star your favourite hikes and keep track of how fresh they are over time</li><br>
							<li>Sort the hikes by additional fields such as distance or elevation</li><br>
							<li>Filter the hikes by additional fields such as district, start point, and end point</li></dd>
